### **1.2. Provide Contribution Guidelines and a Code of Conduct**
Having clear guidelines makes it easier for new contributors to start contributing and ensures a respectful and productive environment.

- **Contribution Guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`):** Detail how to report issues, submit pull requests, coding standards, etc.
- **Code of Conduct (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`):** Outline acceptable behavior and how to handle misconduct.

**Resources:**
- [GitHub's Guide to Contributing](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors)
- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) for a standard Code of Conduct.

### **1.3. Label Issues Appropriately**
Use labels like `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or `documentation` to indicate where help is needed.

**How to Add Labels:**
1. Navigate to the **Issues** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Click on an issue or create a new one.
3. On the right sidebar, under **Labels**, click the gear icon.
4. Select appropriate labels or create new ones if necessary.

**Benefits:**
- **Visibility:** Makes it easier for potential contributors to find tasks suited to their skill level.
- **Clarity:** Clearly communicates what kind of help is needed.
