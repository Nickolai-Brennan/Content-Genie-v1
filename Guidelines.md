Hi everyone!

I've been working on an open-source project called [Detroit Tigers RSS Aggregator](https://github.com/Nickolai-Brennan/detroit-tigers-rss-aggregator) that aggregates the latest news about the Detroit Tigers from multiple RSS feeds. It's built with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.

I'm looking for contributors to help with:
- Enhancing the UI/UX
- Adding new features like search and filtering
- Optimizing the RSS feed fetching process
- Writing comprehensive documentation

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with open-source, your help is welcome!

Feel free to check out the repo and reach out if you're interested in contributing. Any help is appreciated!

Go Tigers! üêØ‚öæÔ∏è
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7 or higher:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git:** [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Virtual Environment Tool:** `venv` (comes with Python)

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or Git Bash and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nickolai-Brennan/detroit-tigers-rss-aggregator.git
cd detroit-tigers-rss-aggregator
```

### Set Up Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**On Windows (Git Bash):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes:*

```
Flask==2.3.2
SQLAlchemy==2.0.15
feedparser==6.0.8
gunicorn==20.1.0
psycopg2-binary==2.9.6
```

### Configure the Database

By default, the application uses SQLite for simplicity. However, for production deployments (e.g., Heroku), it's recommended to use PostgreSQL.

**Using SQLite (Default):**

No additional configuration is needed. The database file `feeds.db` will be created automatically.

**Using PostgreSQL:**

1. **Install PostgreSQL:**
   - Follow instructions [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) based on your OS.

2. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.

3. **Configure `models.py`:**
   - Modify the `DATABASE_URL` to point to your PostgreSQL database.

   ```python
   import os
   DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')  # Heroku sets this automatically
   engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
   ```

---

## Usage

### Fetch RSS Feeds

To manually fetch and store the latest RSS feed entries:

1. **Activate Virtual Environment:**

   **On Windows (Git Bash):**

   ```bash
   source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

   **On macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run the Fetch Script:**

   ```bash
   python fetch_feeds.py
   ```

   *This script parses the defined RSS feeds and stores new entries in the database.*

### Run the Application

1. **Ensure Virtual Environment is Active:**

   *(Refer to the activation steps above.)*

2. **Run the Flask App:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   *The application will start locally at `http://localhost:5000`.*

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the aggregator.

---

## Deployment

Deploying your application ensures it's accessible online. Below are steps to deploy to **Heroku** using **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment.

### Deploying to Heroku

1. **Install Heroku CLI:**

   Download and install from [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

2. **Log In to Heroku:**

   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

3. **Create a Heroku App:**

   ```bash
   heroku create detroit-tigers-rss-aggregator
   ```

4. **Add Heroku Postgres Add-on (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
   ```

5. **Set Environment Variables (If Any):**

   ```bash
   heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

### Automated Deployments with GitHub Actions

Automate deployments so that every push to the `main` branch triggers a deployment to Heroku.

1. **Add Heroku API Key to GitHub Secrets:**

   - **Retrieve Heroku API Key:**

     ```bash
     heroku auth:token
     ```

     *Copy the generated token.*

   - **Add to GitHub:**
     - Go to your GitHub repository.
     - Click on **"Settings"** > **"Secrets and variables"** > **"Actions"**.
     - Click **"New repository secret"**.
     - **Name:** `HEROKU_API_KEY`
     - **Value:** *(Paste your Heroku API key)*
     - Click **"Add secret"**.

2. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow:**

   - **Create Directory:**

     ```bash
     mkdir -p .github/workflows
     ```

   - **Create `deploy.yml`:**

     ```bash
     touch .github/workflows/deploy.yml
     ```

   - **Edit `deploy.yml` in VS Code:**

     Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in VS Code and add the following content:

     ```yaml
     name: Deploy to Heroku

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main  # Change if your default branch is different

     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
         - name: Checkout Code
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v4
           with:
             python-version: '3.10'  # Specify your Python version

         - name: Install Dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -r requirements.txt

         - name: Deploy to Heroku
           uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12
           with:
             heroku_api_key: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY }}
             heroku_app_name: "detroit-tigers-rss-aggregator"  # Replace with your Heroku app name
             heroku_email: "your-email@example.com"           # Replace with your Heroku account email
     ```

     **Important:**
     - Replace `"detroit-tigers-rss-aggregator"` with your actual Heroku app name.
     - Replace `"your-email@example.com"` with your Heroku account email.

   - **Commit and Push Workflow:**

     ```bash
     git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
     git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for Heroku deployment"
     git push
     ```

3. **Monitor GitHub Actions:**

   - Navigate to the **"Actions"** tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Ensure the **"Deploy to Heroku"** workflow runs successfully.
   - Upon success, your application is deployed to Heroku.

4. **Access Your Deployed Application:**

   Visit `https://detroit-tigers-rss-aggregator.herokuapp.com/` *(Replace with your actual Heroku app URL)* to see your live RSS aggregator.
